# web3_demo_flutter

This demo project shows the use of [Flutter Web](https://flutter.dev/multi-platform/web) together with the [flutter_web3](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_web3) package.

The goal was to connect to the Ethereum blockchain via a cryptowallet, connect to the Smart Contract (the address **0x6c6ddD04ADd0a6FC2c121E7DeB4e95744A8B9061** in `lib/main.dart` is the one available in my Ethereum network deployed with [Ganache](https://trufflesuite.com/ganache/), so it does not make sense to other people) and use it.  
The built UI resembles that which I have built for another demo of the library [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.2/). In that case I used **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** together with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

I would say this demo works better than the previous one, but please take a look at it [here](https://github.com/TommasoAzz/web3-demo) if you wish!
